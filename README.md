### Predicting Wikipedia Science Article Quality with Machine Learning



This repository contains an exploratory machine learning analysis of Wikipedia science article quality, using Wikipedia’s official content assessment scale (Stub → Featured Article).



The goal is not to maximize predictive accuracy, but to understand which objective, structural features of an article correlate with perceived quality.



#### Contents

* `notebooks/Final Wikipedia Pipeline.ipynb`  

&nbsp; End-to-end research notebook covering data collection, feature engineering, supervised and unsupervised modeling, and interpretation.



* `src/`, `data/`, `figures/`  

&nbsp; Placeholder directories for future refactoring and modularization.



#### Scope

* ~17,800 science-related Wikipedia articles
* Metadata-based features only (length, references, structure, etc.)
* Emphasis on interpretability and editorial actionability



#### Status

Exploratory research notebook.  

Code refactoring and decomposition are planned but not yet completed.
